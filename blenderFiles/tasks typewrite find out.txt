tasks typewrite:
- find out polarity / wires of stepper motors => youtube video
- test stepper motors with arduino + cnc shield -> test micro stepping
- find out how to trigger hammer with arduino
- find out how starting sequence works
	- home position via stop-switch => connect to cnc shield
	- home position of wheel via clutch? turning the motor two full rotations?
- control complete typewriter:
	- spacing
	- new line
	- type selection 
	- hammer
- how to read inputs from the typewriter keyboard?
	- pass through arduino
	- connect ribbons to arduino digital input and read signal
	- connect / replace with usb keyboard, pass signal through to arduino via
		raspberry pi
